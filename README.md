# Practical Machine Learning - Housing Prices 

This paper looks at the Housing Prices dataset and aims to build a model that accurately predict house prices. The dataset contains features describing houses, e.g. lot size, type of roof, year of build, as well as the sale price of the houses. There are two files that are used in this paper - train.csv (dateset with sale price values) and test.csv (dataset without sale price values). The model is trained on 'train' dataset, while prediction is conducted on 'test' dataset, submitted and checked at the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course). The prediction was constructed with the most popular gradient boosted decision trees algorithm - XGBoost. The final score of predicition on test data usually falls into TOP 4% on public leaderboard in [Kaggle Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/leaderboard)
